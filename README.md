# 🐭🐱 Cat and Rat Game (AI-Powered)

A fun and intelligent path-finding game where a **rat navigates through obstacles, collects food, and avoids a cunning cat** powered by the **A\*** search algorithm.

---

## 🎮 Game Overview

- Control a **rat** in a 2D grid-based environment.
- Avoid a **cat** that uses the **A\*** algorithm to chase you.
- Navigate through **hurdles**, collect **food**, and survive across **4 increasingly difficult levels**.
- You have a limited number of **lives** — make them count!

---

## 🧠 AI Concepts Implemented

- **A\* Search Algorithm**: Used by the cat to find the shortest path to the rat in real-time.
- **Dynamic Environments**: Changing obstacle positions and reward placements with each level.
- **Pathfinding in Maze-like Structures**: Includes weighted and unweighted paths.

## 🍽️ Game Mechanics

| Feature      | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧀 Food       | Scattered across the map; collecting it increases your score.              |
| 🚧 Hurdles    | Act as static or dynamic obstacles. The AI must navigate around them.      |
| 💖 Lives      | The rat has a limited number of lives. Collisions with the cat cost lives. |
| 🎯 Levels     | Four levels with increasing complexity, speed, and obstacle density.       |

## 🗺️ Levels

1. **Level 1** – Basic movement and introduction to food collection.
2. **Level 2** – Introduction of hurdles; slightly smarter AI movement.
3. **Level 3** – Denser obstacles and faster cat.
4. **Level 4** – Complex maze, high-speed chase, and strategic food positioning.
